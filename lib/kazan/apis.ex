  Contains generated API modules as defined in the OAI specs.

  This module contains many sub-modules, one corresponding to each API group
  present in the OpenAPI specification for Kubernetes.

  Each of these modules will contain submodules that repreesent the different
  versions of the API group. Within those submodules will be functions that can
  be called to generate `Kazan.Request` structures that can be fed into
  `Kazan.run`. The version submodules will also contain any structs that can be
  sent & received by that particular version of the API group.

  Each request functions arguments are generated so that any HTTP body parameter
  is first, followed by any path parameters in path order, followed by any
  required query parameters. Optional query parameters should go in the optional
  final keyword argument.
